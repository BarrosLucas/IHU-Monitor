# UHI Monitor

This system leverages computer vision techniques to monitor human heat islands using satellite imagery. It detects areas of high heat concentration in urban environments, providing valuable insights for urban planning, public health, and environmental management through precise thermal maps and detailed reports.

## Features

- **Satellite Imagery Analysis**: Utilizes satellite images to identify and monitor heat islands.
- **Computer Vision Integration**: Advanced algorithms for accurate detection and analysis of heat patterns.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously updates heat maps for dynamic urban environments.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates clear and informative thermal maps and reports.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Automatically triggers alerts for extreme heat conditions.
